1. The gradles, dependencies and implementations are of the latest version as of publishing this project, please update and sync your own project to the latest version.

2. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ONLY RUN THE APP IN DARK MODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [I have not programmed it to work in light mode yet]

3. If you face any issues, bugs, errors or questions regarding the project, please feel free to email me at thetpine254@gmail.com

4. A word of advice, it's ok to take inspiration from other, just do not copy the whole thing blindly, trust me the app won't run if you don't understand what your writing.

Some description of the app.

This app was designed to make the life of our National Service men much easier. As such the app includes three main features,

1. Fitness Tracker
The fitness tracker branches out further into two sub features called IPPT tracker and BMI tracker, the IPPT tracker is a way to keep track of thier progress in the main exercises that military men do during training such as running, push ups and pull up. This will allow then to track how hard they have to train to achieve thier desired score during training.
Next is the BMI tracker which basically keeps track of thier physique by assisting them in calculating thier Body Mass Index which will indicate if thier either at a normal weight, overwieght, obese, severly obese, underweight and severly underweight.

2. Calendar
This calendar feature was implemented to assist the NS men keep track of the events they have on certain days. Moreover, this calendar was programmed to have a two way imteraction; the NS men will be able to add thier own customized events and set remainders when needed too.

3. Bunk mate location
In the military, a buddy system has been emphasized countless times to ensure a safe enviornment for them. As such each person will be assigned a buddy during thier time in camp to keep each other safe at all times. Hence, I have implemented this feature to keep track of thier buddy's location at all time in the camp.

4. The rest of the feature includes settings in which one will be able to customize the app based on thier preference and liking.

5. One does not have to worry about security of thier personal information when they sign up since all user's data has been saved and stored securely inside two databases; one with a SQLite database and the other which is a goole cloud platform called firebase database that syncs with the app at all times.
