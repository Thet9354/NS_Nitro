# NS_Nitro

Dear DSTA Mentor and organizser, thank you for taking the time to go through my project, there are a few things to take note off.

1. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE run the emulator for the app in dark mode, i did not code it to be used in light mode dus to in sufficient time
2. Some of the Activity labeling might be not to your liking but please bear with it.
3. Some sections of the app is incomplete due to insufficient time.


Moreover, I would like to provide a video demo of how to application works below:
